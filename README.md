# Baritone

Baritone is a Baritone-derived pathfinding and automation engine for Minecraft. It
maintains the AltoClef-compatible APIs required by [TenorClef](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/TenorClef)
while tracking a modern Cabaletta Baritone base.

TenorClef decides what to do; Baritone provides movement, mining, building,
inventory, and schematic processes to make it happen.

## Compatibility

| Minecraft | Branch | Java | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.21.11 | `main` | 21 | Primary target |
| 1.16.1 | `1.16.1` | branch-specific | Legacy target |

Baritone `main` is intended for TenorClef's experimental 1.21.11 port. That port does
not currently compile, so it is not a supported release pairing. TenorClef 1.21.1 and
1.21 intentionally resolve matching Baritone artifacts rather than loading an
incompatible Baritone 1.21.11 jar. See [TenorClef's wiring guide](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/TenorClef/blob/main/docs/BARITONE_WIRING.md).

## Build

Java 21 is required on `main`.

On Windows:

```bat
gradlew.bat build
```

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

The first build may take some time: Unimined downloads and remaps Minecraft for the
enabled loaders (Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and Tweaker). Build outputs are written to
`dist/`. To build the Fabric artifact used by TenorClef, run `:fabric:build`.

## TenorClef integration

For the legacy 1.16.1 integration, build the matching Baritone branch first, then
build TenorClef from a sibling directory. Do not point a 1.21 or 1.21.1 TenorClef
build at an artifact produced from `main`.

Before shipping a 1.21.11 paired release, finish TenorClef's source port, tag and
publish the matching Fabric artifact under a pinned version coordinate, then make
TenorClef consume that coordinate.

## Movement backends

Baritone's default pathing behavior is Baritone-compatible. On the primary modern
target, an optional Tungsten physics A* backend can handle goto/custom-goal travel;
mining, digging, schematics, and inventory remain on classic Baritone processes.

| Setting | Values | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `movementBackend` | `baritone` | Always use classic travel |
| `movementBackend` | `tungsten` | Prefer Tungsten; use Baritone if unavailable |
| `movementBackend` | `auto` | Use Tungsten when present, otherwise Baritone |

Install a compatible Tungsten Fabric jar beside Baritone in the game instance, then
choose it with `#set movementBackend tungsten`. If Tungsten is absent, the current
fallback is Baritone. Backend selection should be visible in logs; treat unexpected
fallback as a configuration issue worth reporting.

## Movement features

Beyond upstream Baritone, Baritone adds:

- **Kinematic travel** (`#set kinematicTravel true`, off by default): plain walking
  stretches of a path (traverse, diagonal, 1-block ascend, drops up to 3 blocks) are
  driven by a per-tick physics look-ahead. The controller simulates a set of yaw and jump
  choices with a copy of vanilla player movement, then presses the keys of the one that
  gets furthest along the path while staying on it. Anything it cannot model (breaking,
  placing, water, ladders, parkour) goes back to Baritone. This setting is experimental
  and is being benchmarked with TenorClef's PathBench.
- **Pitfall avoidance** (`pitfallAvoidance`, on by default): the pathfinder never
  stands on sand, gravel or concrete powder resting on a block without collision (air,
  an open fence gate, a sign...), since it can drop out from under the player.
- **Water and air**: swimming, surface travel, and air management that uses bubble and
  magma columns.
- **Boats and elytra**: boat travel, including handling boats occupied by mobs, plus
  elytra gliding with rocket-free descent.
- **Sprint-jumping** on land.
